I'm an undecided student that wants to major in computer science, expected to graduate on 2027

## Favorite CPSC 120L
* LAB 1 -
 
  I really enjoyed this lab because it was the easiest one! It was all about getting familiar with Linux. We learned how to submit assignments and clone a repository for future labs. This lab gave me a solid foundation for the class and a lot of useful background information. I won’t lie, I was initially scared, but once I figured it out, I felt so accomplished.

* LAB 2/6 part 2-
 
  I really enjoyed this lab because it was the 2nd easiest lab :) we ran commands and dove deeper into coding. We also learned how to compile and execute a code (HELLO WORLD) and how to edit the Authors.md file which is all pretty much used for future labs in this class. This lab gave me a lot of foundation and taught me a lot for future labs. I wanted to add the lab 6 part 2 because I'm really into blackjack and I play it on my phone all the time. It was nice to see how the game was programmed and how people use commands like loops in order to execute and run the program (game).
 
* LAB 8 -
 
  I like this lab a lot because we learned how to create patterns with loops it took a while to format. we had to make sure both “pictures” look one to one. We had to count the (line number,dash count, And bar count . there were many loops and they were very confusing to me. This was very challenging but It felt very good once we finally got it to work. This lab was challenging but yet really fun. I really enjoyed doing this lab. Just because it was so hard it gave me a feeling of accomplishment.
